## iAria2 (Another style WebUI for Aria2c)
iAria2 is another style WebUI for aria2c downlaoder. Its based on the project of YAAW. iAria2 is only changed some style from YAAW, core scripts are come from and same with YAAW project.

iAria2's PC side style or user-interface design is reference from Xware project of Xunlei Networks, and I tried to redesigned mobile side user-interface. I think it's more in-line with part of user's usage habits. In the design process, I cancelled some function which users don't or rarely use.

In the final, I have tried to Chinesization (Chinese localization) this copy from YAAW project. And applied the Chineseizated copy of YAAW project in iAria2 project. If you want a non-Chineseizated version of iAria2, Please replace `aria2.js` and `yaaw.js` from origin of YAAW project. (But there are still some words in Chinese)
